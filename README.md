# CUNY 4 All

## Introduction

CUNY 4 All is a centralized platform that addresses the issue of the lack of awareness for CUNY student resources.

Many students miss out on valuable information and resources available at their schools because they are unaware of them. CUNY offers a wealth of support services, such as mental health resources, food pantries, and housing, yet these resources remain underutilized. As a result, students may struggle with challenges that could be mitigated by the support their schools provide, leading to missed opportunities for personal and academic growth.

Our platform has all the essential and important information in one place, negating the possibility of information being overlooked. It has an organized and intuitive interface, simplifying user navigation and enhancing user experience.

## Implemented Features

### AI Chatbot

Our AI chatbot is trained on a large set of data and resources pulled from the CUNY CARES website. The chatbot serves the purpose of accurately directing students to facilities that meet their needs.

### Filter/Display of Data

Students are able to filter through our database of resource centers based off what they need (food, housing, mental health), and where they are located. Results are displayed as markers on an interactive map that we have integrated through the Google Maps API.

### Referral System

Apart from students being able to find centers that meet their essential needs, we also have a referral system in place to promote outreach. Users are able to create an account and share their unique referral code to their peers. Each time their referral code gets entered into our database, they are awarded with points that in the end will reward them.
